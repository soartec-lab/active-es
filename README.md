# ActiveEs

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/active_es`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_es'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_es

## Usage

### STEP1
#### Setting Config
Create config/searchengine.yml

See: spec/dummy/config/searchengine.yml

### STEP2
#### Inherit `ActiveEs::Base`

```
class Content < ActiveEs::Base
end
```

### STEP3
#### Define the property of model. 

format is `property :field_name, type: 'detatype', options... `
To check the specifiable detatype, execute the following command on rails console.

```
$ bundle exec rails console
$ ActiveEs::Schema::Definition::FieldDetaTypes
```

FYI: spec/dummy/app/models/content.ru
class Content < ActiveEs::Base
  property :title, type: 'text', analyzer: 'kuromoji'
  property :description, type: 'text', analyzer: "kuromoji"
  property :number, type: 'integer'
  property :rank, type: 'integer'
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
